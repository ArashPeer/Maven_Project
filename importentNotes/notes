Cucumber Expression:
If the capture group expression is identical to one of the registered parameter types’s regexp,
the captured string will be transformed before it is passed to the step definition’s method.
In the example above, the cukes argument will be an integer, because the built-in int parameter type’s regexp is \d+ .

1- The good thing about cucumber expression is that once your defined it correctly later if you change the step
definition you don't need to overload the cod.

RUNNER CLASS

In Cucumber, a runner class serves as an entry point to execute Cucumber scenarios (feature files).
It is responsible for configuring and running Cucumber tests. The runner class typically includes annotations
such as @RunWith(Cucumber.class) and @CucumberOptions to specify the location of feature files, step definitions,
and other settings. When you run the runner class, it triggers the execution of Cucumber scenarios, and the results
 are reported.
